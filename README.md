# VeryDeepLearning
This is a repository for the exercises of the lecture Very Deep Learning

# The notebooks displayed here are not all originally written by me but some are a part of the exercises for the above name lecture. I only add my solutions to the exercise questions in them. I also use the other notebooks to go a bit deeper into the contents explained in the lecture and other content as well to further my experience in working with different models and frameworks.
