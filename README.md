# VeryDeepLearning
This is a repository for the exercises of the lecture Very Deep Learning

# The notebooks displayed here are not originally written by me but are a part of the exercises for the above name lecture. I only add my solutions to the exercise questions in them. I also use the notebooks to go a bit deeper into the contents explained in the lecture.
